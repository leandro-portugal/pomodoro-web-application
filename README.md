# Pomodoro Web Application

## Description

This is an example of a Pomodoro timer application. The application uses JavaScript to control the timer logic and CSS to animate a circle representing the remaining time.

## Features

The application has the following features:

- **Start/Pause:** Clicking the "Start" button starts the timer and begins counting down the time. If the timer is already running, clicking the "Pause" button will pause the timer.
- **Reset:** Clicking the "Reset" button resets the timer to the initial values.
- **Time Control:** The time is displayed in the "MM:SS" format and is updated in real-time as the timer runs.
- **Work and Break Mode:** The application automatically switches between work and break modes. The current mode is displayed in the "time-mode" element.
- **Number of Turns:** The current number of turns completed is displayed in the "turns" element.

## Usage

1. Download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. Open the HTML file in your web browser.
3. Click the "Start" button to start the timer.
4. Click the "Pause" button to pause the timer.
